You can adapt Static CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). You can also create your own custom backend.

You can add Static CMS to your site in two different ways:

- [CDN hosting](/docs/add-to-your-site-cdn)
- [bundling directly into your app](/docs/add-to-your-site-bundling)
