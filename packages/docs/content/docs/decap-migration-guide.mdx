Static CMS is a fork of [Decap](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms) (previously Netlify CMS). Many changes have been made, some big, some small.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps of migrating from Decap or Netlify to Static CMS.

## How to Migrate

Start by replacing Decap / Netlify with Static CMS, then address the changes below.

### CDN

Decap (_remove_):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^3.0.0/dist/decap-cms.js"></script>
```

Netlify (_remove_):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
```

Static CMS (_add_):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^4.0.0-beta.8/dist/static-cms-app.js"></script>
```

### Bundling

```bash
# Uninstall Decap
npm uninstall decap-cms-app
npm uninstall decap-cms-core

# Uninstall Netlify
npm uninstall netlify-cms-app
npm uninstall netlify-cms-core

# Install Static CMS
npm install @staticcms/core
```

#### Change your imports

Decap (_remove_):

```js
import CMS from 'decap-cms-app';
```

Netlify (_remove_):

```js
import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app';
```

Static CMS (_add_):

```js
import CMS from '@staticcms/core';
```

## Changes

### React 18

React `18.2.0` is now the minimum supported React version. If you are using Static CMS through a CDN, this comes bundled.

### Static CMS Styles

Static CMS bundles its styles separately from the main javascript file, so you will need to import them separately.

**CDN**:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^2.0.0/dist/main.css" />
```

**Bundling**:

```js
import '@staticcms/core/dist/main.css';
```

### Backends

The Azure backend has been removed. All other backends are still supported.

However, the Gitlab, Client-Side Implicit Grant has been removed as a method of authentication.

### Dates

[Moment](https://momentjs.com/) has been dropped as the date library used. Instead we are now using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/). Date formats in your configuration will need to be updated. See [format docs](https://date-fns.org/docs/format).

### Initializing Static CMS

CMS must be explicitly initiated by calling `CMS.init()`. Passing a config to `CMS.init()` will now completely override `config.yml` (they are now exclusive), instead of being merged with `config.yml`

### Markdown Editor

A [new markdown editor](/docs/widget-markdown) has been added. It comes with a new [shortcode](/docs/widget-markdown#shortcodes) system, old editor components no longer work.

### Sortable Fields

The `sortable_fields` configuration option has been slightly changed, as we now allow a [default sorting option](/docs/collection-overview#default-sort).

**Decap / Netlify**:

```yaml
sortable_fields:
  - field1
  - field2
```

**Static CMS**:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
sortable_fields:
  fields:
    - field1
    - field2
```

```js
sortable_fields: {
  fields: ['field1', 'field2'];
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### View Filters

The `view_filters` configuration option has been slightly changed, as we now allow a [default filter option](/docs/collection-overview#view-filters). Also each filter now requires a unique name.

**Decap / Netlify**:

```yaml
view_filters:
  - label: "Alice's and Bob's Posts"
    field: author
    pattern: 'Alice|Bob'
  - label: 'Posts published in 2020'
    field: date
    pattern: '2020'
  - label: Drafts
    field: draft
    pattern: true
```

**Static CMS**:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
view_filters:
  fields:
    - name: alice-and-bob
      label: "Alice's and Bob's Posts"
      field: author
      pattern: 'Alice|Bob'
    - name: posts-2020
      label: 'Posts published in 2020'
      field: date
      pattern: '2020'
    - name: drafts
      label: Drafts
      field: draft
      pattern: true
```

```js
view_filters: {
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'alice-and-bob',
      label: "Alice's and Bob's Posts",
      field: 'author',
      pattern: 'Alice|Bob',
    },
    {
      name: 'posts-2020',
      label: 'Posts published in 2020',
      field: 'date',
      pattern: '2020',
    },
    {
      name: 'drafts',
      label: 'Drafts',
      field: 'draft',
      pattern: true,
    },
  ];
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### View Groups

The `view_groups` configuration option has been slightly changed, as we now allow a [default grouping option](/docs/collection-overview#view-groups). Also each group now requires a unique name.

**Decap / Netlify**:

```yaml
view_groups:
  - label: Year
    field: date
    # groups items based on the value matched by the pattern
    pattern: \d{4}
  - label: Drafts
    field: draft
```

**Static CMS**:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
view_groups:
  groups:
    - name: by-year
      label: Year
      field: date
      # groups items based on the value matched by the pattern
      pattern: \d{4}
    - name: drafts
      label: Drafts
      field: draft
```

```js
view_groups: {
  groups: [
    {
      name: "by-year",
      label: "Year",
      field: "date",
      pattern: "\\d{4}
    },
    {
      name: "drafts",
      label: "Drafts",
      field: "draft"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### List Widget

Support in the List Widget for the `field` property has been dropped. A single field in the `fields` property [achieves the same behavior](/docs/widget-list).

### Custom Widgets

Custom widget creation has changed. `createClass` has been removed. Custom widgets should all be [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) now.

There have also been changes to how custom widgets are registered and the properties passed to the controls and previews. See [custom widgets](/docs/custom-widgets) for full details.

### Custom Previews

Custom preview creation has changed. `createClass` has been removed. Custom previews should all be [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) now.

There have also been changes to the properties passed to custom previews. See [custom previews](/docs/custom-previews) for full details.

### External integrations

The following external integrations have been removed:

- Algolia
- AssetStore
- Cloudinary
- Uploadcare

### Deprecated Features

- All deprecated features were removed
  - `date` widget has been removed
  - `datetime` widget
    - `dateFormat` has been removed (Use `date_format` instead)
    - `timeFormat` has been removed (Use `time_format` instead)

### Media Library

The `getAsset` method has been removed, the new `useMediaAsset` hook should be used instead. See [Interacting With The Media Library](/docs/custom-widgets#interacting-with-the-media-library).

### Beta Features

The following beta features from Decap / Netlify have been dropped:

- GraphQL support for GitHub and GitLab
- Remark plugins (new markdown editor has its own plugin system)
- Dynamic Default Values
- Custom Mount Element

#### Nested Collections

[Nested Collections](/docs/collection-types#nested-collections) have some breaking config changes. The `meta` config has been dropped and its `path` property has been moved into the `nested` prop. You can also no longer specify the widget type for the path.

**Old Config**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
collections:
  - name: pages
    label: Pages
    label_singular: 'Page'
    folder: content/pages
    create: true
    nested:
      depth: 100
      summary: '{{title}}'
    fields:
      - label: Title
        name: title
        widget: string
      - label: Body
        name: body
        widget: markdown
    meta: { path: { widget: string, label: 'Path', index_file: 'index' } }
```

```js
{
  collections: [
    {
      name: 'pages',
      label: 'Pages',
      label_singular: 'Page',
      folder: 'content/pages',
      create: true,
      nested: {
        depth: 100,
        summary: '{{title}}',
      },
      fields: [
        {
          label: 'Title',
          name: 'title',
          widget: 'string',
        },
        {
          label: 'Body',
          name: 'body',
          widget: 'markdown',
        },
      ],
      meta: {
        path: {
          widget: 'string',
          label: 'Path',
          index_file: 'index',
        },
      },
    },
  ];
}
```
