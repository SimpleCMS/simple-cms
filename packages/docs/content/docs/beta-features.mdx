Static CMS runs new functionality in an open beta format from time to time. That means that this functionality is fully available for use, and it might be ready for primetime, but it could break or change without notice.

**Use these features at your own risk.**

## Editorial Workflow

By default, all entries created or edited in Static CMS are committed directly into the main repository branch.

The publish_mode option allows you to enable "Editorial Workflow" mode for more control over the content publishing phases. All unpublished entries will be arranged in a board according to their status, and they can be further reviewed and edited before going live.

See [Editorial Workflow](/docs/editorial-workflow) for more information.

## Open Authoring

When using the [GitHub backend](/docs/github-backend), you can use Static CMS to accept contributions from GitHub users without giving them access to your repository. When they make changes in the CMS, the CMS forks your repository for them behind the scenes, and all the changes are made to the fork. When the contributor is ready to submit their changes, they can set their draft as ready for review in the CMS. This triggers a pull request to your repository, which you can merge using the GitHub UI.

At the same time, any contributors who _do_ have write access to the repository can continue to use Static CMS normally.

See [Open Authoring](/docs/open-authoring) for more information.
