By default, all entries created or edited in Static CMS are committed directly into the main repository branch.

The `publish_mode` option allows you to enable "Editorial Workflow" mode for more control over the content publishing phases. All unpublished entries will be arranged in a board according to their status, and they can be further reviewed and edited before going live.

You can enable the Editorial Workflow with the following line in your `config.yml` file:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
publish_mode: editorial_workflow
```

```js
publish_mode: 'editorial_workflow';
```

</CodeTabs>
