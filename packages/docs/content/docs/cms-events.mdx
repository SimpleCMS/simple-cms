## Mounted Event

The `mounted` event handler fires once Static CMS is fully loaded.

```javascript
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'mounted',
  handler: () => {
    // your code here
  },
});
```

## Login Event

The `login` event handler fires when a user logs into Static CMS.

```javascript
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'login',
  handler: ({ author: { login, name } }) => {
    // your code here
  },
});
```

## Logout Event

The `logout` event handler fires when a user logs out of Static CMS.

```javascript
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'logout',
  handler: () => {
    // your code here
  },
});
```

## Change Event

The `change` event handler fires when a user changes the value of a field in the editor. Event listeners for `change` must provide a field name, and can be used to modify the entry data like so:

```javascript
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'change',
  collection: 'posts',
  field: 'path.to.my.field',
  handler: ({ data, collection, field }) => {
    const currentValue = data.path.to.my.field;

    return {
      ...data,
      path: {
        ...data.path,
        to: {
          ...data.path.to,
          my: {
            ...data.path.to.my,
            field: `new${currentValue}`,
          },
        },
      },
    };
  },
});
```

## Pre Save Event

The `preSave` event handler fires before the changes have been saved to your git backend, and can be used to modify the entry data like so:

```javascript
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'preSave',
  collection: 'posts',
  handler: ({ data: { entry } }) => {
    return {
      ...entry.data,
      title: 'new title',
    };
  },
});
```

## Post Save Event

The `postSave` event handler fires after the changes have been saved to your git backend.

```javascript
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'postSave',
  collection: 'posts',
  handler: ({ data: { entry } }) => {
    // your code here
  },
});
```
